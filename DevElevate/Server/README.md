## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB database
- Gmail account for email services

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
MAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
MAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
FRONTEND_URL=your_frontend_url
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### Database Connection

The server automatically connects to MongoDB when the `MONGO_URI` environment variable is available. PDF routes will work without database connection for testing purposes.
