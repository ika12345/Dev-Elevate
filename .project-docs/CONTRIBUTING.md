## 🚀 Quick Start – How to Contribute

### 1. 🌟 Star the Repository

Give this repo a star to show your support!

### 2. 🍴 Fork This Repo

Click the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repository.

### 3. 📥 Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Dev-Elevate.git
cd Dev-Elevate
```

### 4. 📦 Install Dependencies

This project has separate **Client** (frontend) and **Server** (backend) components. You need to install dependencies for both:

**📱 For the Client (Frontend - React/Vite):**
```bash
cd DevElevate/Client
npm install
```

**🖥️ For the Server (Backend - Node.js/Express):**
```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
npm install
```

### 5. 🚀 Run the Project (Dev Mode)

You need to run both the client and server in **separate terminals**:

**Terminal 1 - Start the Server (Backend):**
```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
node index.js
```

**Terminal 2 - Start the Client (Frontend):**
```bash
cd DevElevate/Client
npm run dev
```

> **💡 Platform Notes:** 
> - **Windows:** Use `cd DevElevate\Client` and `cd DevElevate\Server` (backslashes)
> - **Linux/Mac:** Use `cd DevElevate/Client` and `cd DevElevate/Server` (forward slashes)
> - The client will typically run on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default)
> - The server will run on a port specified in the backend configuration

### 5.1. 🔧 Environment Configuration (Optional)

**For Server Setup:**
If you need to configure environment variables:
```bash
cd DevElevate/Server
# Copy the sample env file (if it exists)
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration
```

Sure! Here's the updated and corrected contribution guideline, highlighting that **all commits should be made directly to the `main` branch** of the forked repository before creating a pull request:

---

### 6. 🔄 Add Remote Upstream

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/abhisek2004/Dev-Elevate.git
git pull upstream main
```

---

### 7. 🌿 Always Work on Your `main` Branch

> ⚠️ **Important:** For this project, **do not create a new branch. Always make your changes directly in your forked repository’s `main` branch**.

```bash
git checkout main
```

Make sure you're on your fork's `main` branch before making changes.


### 8. 💻 Make Your Changes

Work your magic! ✨
Fix bugs, enhance UI, write logic — whatever your contribution is.

### 9. ✅ Add & Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Your concise commit message here"
```

### 10. 🚀 Push to Your Fork (Main Branch Only)

```bash
git push origin main
```

Or, if using a separate feature branch:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 11. 🔁 Create Pull Request (PR)

Go to your **forked repository** → Click on `Compare & Pull Request` → Submit your changes to the `main` branch of [Dev-Elevate](https://github.com/abhisek2004/Dev-Elevate.git)

---

✅ **Important**:

* Ensure your PR is from your **fork’s `main` branch** to `abhisek2004/Dev-Elevate`'s `main`.
* Do **not create PRs to any other branch**.
